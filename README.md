# Minimalist Todo App  
**A zero-dependency, offline-capable and simple task manager**  
 

## Why It's Useful  
- **No login required** - Works instantly in any browser  
- **Persists locally** - Uses `localStorage` to save tasks 
- **Zero frills or fluff** - Dead simple usage and design.    

## Tech Used  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)  
- CSS Grid/Flexbox  
- Mobile-responsive design  

Built to master DOM manipulation without frameworks, and because I get tired of everything requiring logins and accounts nowadays!
